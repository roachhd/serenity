The Agreement
=============

This isn't meant to be a book that you glance through and then set aside. It's also not about general philosophy or life advice. It's not meant to get you to buy into a program.

What is this book for then?

It's meant for action. 

The intent of this book is for you to:

1. Read it in an hour. Not put aside, but actually read it. 
2. Put the method into action. Immediately.
3. Practice the skills daily, just a few minutes a day. In a short time, you should have some basic skills that help you to be content, less angry, less stressed out.

How does that sound? 

If youâ€™re happy with that, let's make an agreement:

1. You do those three things.
2. You also agree to close everything else on your computer and give yourself an hour of undistracted time to read this book.
