The root of the Problem
=======================

Almost every kind of problem we have has discontent with ourselves (and our lives) as its root.

I'll repeat that for emphasis: **All of our problems stem from discontent**.

Let's take a look at a variety of examples:

1. Addicted to food: Food gives you temporary happiness, you seek happiness from external sources because you aren't happy with yourself. The pleasure from food is temporary, making you a bit depressed that you ate so much junk, making you unhappier, causing you to seek comfort from the food.
2. Addicted to cigarettes, drugs, pills, alcohol: Same reason as food addiction, same cycle.
3. Addicted to the Internet, video games, porn: See above.
4. Debt and clutter: You buy things as a source of external happiness (see above), and are afraid of what will happen if you let go of those things. This is a lack of confidence that you'll be OK with nothing but yourself.
